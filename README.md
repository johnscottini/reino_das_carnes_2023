This project is a final project of a college subject, the main goal of this project was to practice HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript integration, the use of events, CSS selectors, forms and JavaScript validations by creating a website of a hypothetical steakhouse. 
The checkboxes, radio buttons and dropdown were designed from scratch.

The hardest part was making the dropdown and radio buttons fully operationals and creating the page design.
